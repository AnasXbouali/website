        Since September 2024, I am a postdoctoral researcher at INRAE Occitanie-Montpellier, as a member of UMR MISTEA working with Alain Rapaport (Senior Researcher at INRAE Montpellier). I specialize in applied mathematics, with a focus on optimal control and optimization, particularly in hybrid systems. My research applies these techniques to areas such as modeling and epidemiology.

        Before that, from September 1, 2023 to August 31, 2024, I was a ATER (Temporary Lecturer and Research Assistant) at Avignon Universit√©.

        Prior to that, from October 1, 2020, to November 17, 2023, I was a PhD student at Avignon Universit√©. My PhD supervisors were T√©rence Bayen (Prof. at Avignon Universit√©) and Lo√Øc Bourdin (MCF HDR at Limoges Universit√©). My research involved the derivation of first-order necessary optimality conditions for optimal control problems involving spatially heterogeneous dynamics and their applications to optimal control problems with loss control regions.
